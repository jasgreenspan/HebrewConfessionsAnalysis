# Hebrew Confessions Page Analysis
## Overview
I designed a basic workflow for analysing Hebrew confessions pages from Facebook, involving the scraping, parsing, and basic anaylsis, such as wordclouds.

## Details
The current setup of the workflow is for analysing the LGBTQ Religious confessions page, but could be used for any Hebrew Facebook page (not just confessions).
Each post is sent to Bar Ilan's Hebrew parser to separate the words into indiviudal morphemes. This takes some time.
